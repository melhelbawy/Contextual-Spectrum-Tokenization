# Contextual Spectrum Tokenization (CST)

![CST Architecture Diagram](docs/cst_pipeline_flow.png) <!-- Placeholder for your main architecture diagram -->

## 🌟 Overview

This repository provides the official implementation for **Contextual Spectrum Tokenization (CST)**, a novel hybrid dynamic tokenization architecture designed to overcome the limitations of static embedding lookups in modern transformer models. CST selectively applies dynamic, context-aware representations where semantic disambiguation is most critical, significantly enhancing transformer efficiency and semantic fidelity without incurring prohibitive computational costs.

My work introduces a **semantic spectrum manifold** that adapts token representations based on local textual context, document-level signals, and multimodal information. Through intelligent caching, selective activation, and optimized training procedures, CST offers a practical and production-ready solution for more intelligent, environment-aware text representation.

This project is a direct implementation of the architecture detailed in my paper:

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Hybrid Tokenization:** Dynamically generates context-aware representations for ambiguous tokens while leveraging static embeddings for unambiguous ones, balancing fidelity and efficiency.
*   **Semantic Spectrum Manifold:** A continuously learned embedding space that adapts token positions based on rich contextual information (local, document-level, multimodal, user-specific).
*   **Computational Efficiency:** Incorporates intelligent multi-level caching (in-memory LRU, distributed Redis), selective activation based on an Ambiguity Classifier, and lightweight architecture design.
*   **Training Stability:** Employs controlled spectrum evolution, anchor points, and multi-scale training to ensure robust and stable representation learning.
*   **Multimodal Integration:** Designed with explicit integration points for visual, audio, and metadata signals to enrich textual token representations.
*   **Production-Ready:** Includes considerations and components for efficient inference pipelines, comprehensive monitoring, and scalable deployment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   PyTorch 1.9+
*   Other dependencies (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cst-implementation.git
    cd cst-implementation
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(You might need to install `torch` and `torchvision` separately if `pip install -r` has issues, ensuring compatibility with your CUDA version if you plan to use a GPU.)*

## 📖 Usage

### Training a CST Model

To pre-train a CST-enhanced transformer model using the combined contrastive and masked language modeling objective:

```bash
python scripts/train_cst.py --config configs/base_config.yaml
```

*   **Configuration:** Adjust training parameters, dataset paths, model dimensions, and hyper-parameters in the `configs/base_config.yaml` file.
*   **Data Preparation:** Ensure your training data is prepared according to the `CSTPretrainer`'s `prepare_cst_input` method expectations (e.g., tokenized fragments, context data, negative samples for contrastive learning).

### Inference with ProductionCST

For efficient inference using the multi-level caching system:

```python
from cst.deployment.production_cst import ProductionCST
from cst.configs.config import get_config # Assuming a config loading utility

# Load configuration
config = get_config('production_config.yaml')

# Initialize the production inference pipeline
production_model = ProductionCST(model_path="path/to/your/trained_cst_model.pt", config=config)

# Example: Encode a batch of text fragments with context
text_fragments = [
    torch.tensor([101, 2054, 2003, 1996, 2041, 102]), # Example: "The bank is open."
    torch.tensor([101, 1996, 4248, 2003, 1996, 3072, 102]) # Example: "The river bank is muddy."
]
context_data = {
    'document_embedding': torch.randn(2, 768),
    'image_embedding': torch.randn(2, 512),
    # ... other context features as expected by your model
}

# Asynchronous call for batch encoding
import asyncio
async def run_encoding():
    encoded_vectors = await production_model.encode_batch(text_fragments, context_data)
    print(encoded_vectors.shape) # Expected: [batch_size, d_model]

asyncio.run(run_encoding())
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model on various benchmarks:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py --model_path path/to/your/trained_cst_model.pt --config configs/evaluation_config.yaml
```

*   Refer to `cst/evaluation/benchmarks.py` for details on how different evaluation tasks (WSD, efficiency, multimodal) are implemented.

**Important Customization Points for you:**

1.  **`![CST Architecture Diagram](docs/cst_pipeline_flow.png)`**:
    *   **Image Path:** You need to create your architecture diagrams (like the CST Pipeline Flow diagram I described) and save them in a `docs/` folder (or another suitable location). Then, update the `path` in `(docs/cst_pipeline_flow.png)` to point to your actual diagram image. If you have multiple, you can add more images or link to a `docs/` folder that contains them.
    *   **Actual Diagrams:** This is where you'd place the rendered Mermaid diagrams (saved as PNGs or SVGs).

2.  **`[[Preprint Link / Journal Link (if available)]](YOUR_PAPER_LINK_HERE)`**:
    *   Once your paper is available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) or published in a journal, replace `YOUR_PAPER_LINK_HERE` with the actual URL.

3.  **Installation / Usage Examples:**
    *   The code snippets in the "Installation" and "Usage" sections are illustrative. You **must** replace them with precise instructions and actual, runnable code snippets from your repository that reflect how someone would truly install your dependencies, run your training script, or use your `ProductionCST` class.
    *   Pay close attention to placeholders like `"path/to/your/trained_cst_model.pt"` and example `torch.tensor` inputs.

4.  **`[Your GitHub Profile Link]`**: Replace this with your actual GitHub profile URL.

5.  **`[Your LinkedIn Profile Link (Optional)]`**: Add this if you wish.

6.  **`LICENSE` file**: Ensure you have a `LICENSE` file in your repository (e.g., `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.txt`) with the MIT License text. GitHub provides options to add a license when you create a new repository or you can add it manually.

7.  **`requirements.txt`**: Make sure this file accurately lists all Python dependencies.

By filling in these specifics, you'll have a highly professional and functional `README.md` for your CST project!
